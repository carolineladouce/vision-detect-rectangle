# Vision Detect Rectangle

This is my implementation of the [Detecting Rectangles](https://medium.com/@s.deluca/swift-detecting-rectangles-5c15209f6601) tutorial by Salvatore De Luca (thanks Salvatore!).  This project uses Swift, UIKit, AVFoundation and Vision.

## What I learned 

Perform a VNDetectRectanglesRequest to recognize rectangles in an image and return the result in a VNRectangleObservation object 

Draw a rectangle onscreen that outlines the detected rectangle from a VNRectangleObservation
